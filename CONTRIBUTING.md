# Contributing Guide

Thank you for contributing to Yandex Webmaster MCP. This guide outlines quality expectations and the contribution process.

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Go 1.25+

```bash
make check
```

Run container integration checks with `make docker-test`. Tests use fixtures and never require Yandex credentials.

## Commits — Iterative and Atomic

Follow [ACDD](https://opatsay.com/ru/atomarnye-kommity-acdd):

- Keep changes **small and atomic**: one commit = one complete, verified outcome; include all files required for that outcome
- Every published commit must build and pass the checks present at that point
- Keep a bug fix and its regression test together; separate passing characterization tests are welcome
- Update mutually dependent tooling/configuration in the same commit
- Prefer one file per commit when that file delivers a self-contained, verifiable change
- Keep multiple files together only when they are required for the same complete step; explain that dependency in the commit body
- Split independent changes even when they touch the same file
- Write the intended step before editing, verify it, then commit before starting the next step
- Review every commit in order before merging
- Prefer small, focused pull requests

## Mandatory Comments and Tests

- Public types and non-trivial logic must include comments that explain the **why**
- New features **must include unit tests**; bug fixes should include a regression test
- Do not regress quality: run `make check` before pushing

## Commit Message Convention
